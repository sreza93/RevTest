All ASCII (includes pure text, .csv, etc.) data must be included here. Every plot's data needs to be here at every commit. In case of binary data (such as figures, that goes into the figures subfolder). Create subfolders under data for each tool used. Data file names must be of the form: <Date>_<Student>_<Tool>_<BriefComment such as device number, etc.>.txt. The file names must not contain any spaces or special characters other than underscore (_) at all.
